I'm and Undergrad student in Computer Engineering at Universidade de Campinas (UNICAMP - Brazil) who is trying his luck with game development!

Currently I'm programming random games for learning purposes and studying Computer Graphics by my own. The OpenGL waters are DEEP AND I'M DROWNING HELP. I'm also starting to research Deep Learning topics and have worked on a few projects about it during the CE course.

Besides that, I try to create some pixel art from time to time and think about stories, plots and mechanics to fit the games I dream of making. Game Design is very very interesting!
